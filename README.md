# Hypixel-Skyblock-Frming-KeyTimer
A simple, open-source tool that measures how long specific keys are held during Hypixel Skyblock farming, then lets you replay those timings with audio cues. Built with Python, Tkinter, and pynput.  This tool is designed for quality-of-life testing and timing analysis. It does not automate gameplay, and does not send or store any keystrokes.
